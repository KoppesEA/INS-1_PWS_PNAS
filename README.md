# INS-1_PWS_PNAS
Markdown on the useage of uploaded bash scripts for RNA-Seq analysis associated with Koppes et al. 2021 for analysis of total- and small- RNA-Seq of control and PWS INS-1 cells.  

Fastq files associated with this study can be found via GEO  
GSExxxx  (Total RNA)  
and  
GSExxx  (small RNA)


*Directories and version numbers may need to be adjusted within each script by user to run as needed*

## Part I: Custom Genome Generation
Download Rnor6 top level genome sequence and gene set annotation from Ensembl (https://useast.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html)  

    wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-98/fasta/rattus_norvegicus/dna/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.dna.toplevel.fa.gz
    wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-98/gtf/rattus_norvegicus/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.98.gtf.gz

Note that as of 10/21/2021 current genome and annotation is now Rnor_6.0.104  

Unzip the genome fasta file and then append the custom transgne sequences from `mINS2tg.fa` and `hINStg.fa`

     gunzip -c Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.dna.toplevel.fa.gz > Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.dna.toplevel.fa
     cat Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.dna.toplevel.fa hINStg.fa mINS2tg.fa > Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.dna.custom.fa
     gunzip -c Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.98.gtf.gz > Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.98.gtf
     cat Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.98.gtf CustomAnnot.gtf > Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.98.custom.gtf
     
Generate STAR genomic indexes from custom rat genome and annotation using `genomeGenerate` command from STAR version 2.7.0e with options specified in batch script `STARgenomeGen_custom.sh`  

Generate RSEM-STAR genomic indexes from custom rat genome and annotation using `rsem-prepare-reference` command with RSEM version 1.3.1 with options specified in batch script `RSEM_RnorV98customprep.sh`  

Generate Bowtie2 indexes from Rnor6.0.99 (without custom annotation) using the `bowtie2-build` command with bowtie2 version 2.3.4.2 with options specified in batch script `Bowtie_Rnor6v99_build.sh`

## Part II: Identification of differentially expressed genes  in total RNA using STAR alignment with gene feature counts by HT-Seq and comparison with DEseq2
RNA-seq QC check using `FastQC` version 0.11.5 and illumina NextSeq adapters trimmed using `TrimGalore` version 0.4.5 as specified in `Total_RNA_QCandTRIM.sh` with the sample list file `expList_2017.txt`  

Splice-aware refrence-based alignment using STAR version 2.7.0e was implemented with options specified in `STAR_RnorCustom_mapping.sh` combined with the custom annotation genomic indexes generated in Part I.

Gene-level feature counts were made with HTseq version 0.11.2 using parameters specified in `HTSeq_Rnorcustom_v98.sh`.  
*Note that the settings* `--mode union` *and* `--nonqunique all` *were required to accurately quantify the overlapping bicistronic Snurf-Snrpn transcript and the multicopy Snord115 and Snord116 genes.*  

The DESeq2 version 3.9 R package (R version 3.6) was used for differential expression anlaysis as implemented in R script `Deseq2_STARHTSeq_RScript.R`.  
*Significance cutoffs of padj<0.10 lenient or padj<0.05 stringent were used in the identification of differentially expressed genes to investigate further.*
